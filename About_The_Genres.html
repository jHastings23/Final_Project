            <h2>Reggae</h2>
            <p>Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The genre is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics, and it was made famous worldwide by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Reggae music is often associated with the Rastafari movement, an influence not just on the music itself but also on the cultural and political movements of the time.</p>

            <h2>Dancehall</h2>
            <p>Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially, dancehall was a sparser version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Over the years, dancehall evolved into a very digital music style with faster rhythms. Artists like Vybz Kartel have become synonymous with the dancehall genre.</p>
