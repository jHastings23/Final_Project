        <h2>About Dancehall and Reggae</h2>

        <p>Dancehall and Reggae are two of Jamaica's most internationally recognized music genres, both rooted in the rich cultural tapestry of the island. <strong>Reggae</strong>, which emerged in the late 1960s, is known for its laid-back rhythms and socially conscious lyrics, heavily influenced by earlier forms like ska and rocksteady. <strong>Dancehall</strong>, evolving in the late 1970s, represents a more direct and energetic branch of reggae, with faster rhythms and often focusing on daily life and societal issues.</p>
